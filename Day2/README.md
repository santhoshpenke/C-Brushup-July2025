# C Brush-Up – July 2025

📘 This repository contains a series of daily C programming practice files aimed at strengthening the core concepts of C for Embedded Systems and microcontroller programming.

Each folder represents one day of focused practice, with clear and simple programs covering the foundational topics.

---

## ✅ Day 1 – Basics

📁 **Folder:** `Day1_Basics`

Programs included:
- `add.c` – Takes two numbers and prints their sum.
- `max.c` – Compares two numbers and prints the larger one (or if they are equal).
- `calculator.c` – Menu-driven calculator using `switch-case` with options for add, subtract, multiply, divide, and exit.

📌 Concepts Practiced:
- Input/output using `scanf` and `printf`
- Arithmetic operations
- Conditional statements (`if`, `else`)
- `switch-case` control structure
- Infinite loop (`while(1)`)
- Safe division (handling divide by zero)
- Program termination with `exit(0)`
